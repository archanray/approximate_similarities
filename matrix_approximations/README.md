# Matrix approximation algorithms

This repository contains code and models for symmetric similarity matrix approximations.

1. `run_glue` can generate the required similarity matrix. This code is based on

2. `direct_nystrom_with_and_without_eig_corr.py` contains all versions of approximation algorithms. You choose and pick whichever to use.

3. `GLUE_BERT_STSB.py` can help you compute downstream task performance measures.

4. `wme_appx.py` can approximate any `n x n` matrix. By putting it in context of the WMD matrix. 

Each files can be run using python `XXXX.py`
